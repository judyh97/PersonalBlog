"You were hurt, a little, weren't you?" his wife had asked. 
"I'm human, after all. I was hurt," he'd replied. 
But that wasn't true. Half of it, at least, was a lie. I wasn't hurt enough when I should have been, Kino admitted to himself. When I should have felt real pain, I stifled it. I didn't want to take it on, so I avoided facing up to it. Which is why my heart is so empty now. The snakes have grabbed the spot and are trying to hide their coldly beating hearts there.

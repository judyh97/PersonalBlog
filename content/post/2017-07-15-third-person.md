Imagine Chekhov's story "Grief" in the first person. An old man telling us his son has just died. We would feel embarassed, uncomfortable, even bored, reacting precisely as the cabman's fares in the story did. But Chekov's impartial voice imbues the man with dignity. We absorb the author's compassion for him and are deeply moved, if not by the son's death, by the old man talking to his horse. 

I think it's because we are all pretty insecure.
